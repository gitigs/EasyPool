# What is EasyPool?

EasyPool is a service for creating and automating pools using smart contracts. A pool is a collection of investor funds pooled together with the sole intention of investing in ICO.

EasyPool makes it possible to automate the process of funds raising for group participation in ICO with an easy distribution of the ICO tokens, as soon as they are received, in exactly the same proportion as the investment was made in Ethereum using the smart contract. Thus the administrator does not need to manually administer the pool, and pool members do not have to re-check the correctness of the pool calculations. That all without additional security risks for the funds, since EasyPool as a service does not have an access to the funds in any period of the time.
